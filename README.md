# Reinforcement learning driven heuristic for two-dimensional bandwidth minimization
The two sets of 90 benchmark instances used in our draft titled with "Reinforcement learning driven heuristic for two-dimensional bandwidth minimization" are publicly available at https://www.heuristicas.es/. To facilitate the further research, we upload the instances here.

The source code of the proposed RLTS algorithm will be made available upon the publication of the paper.
